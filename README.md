# Model
Code creates a basic 3D model with perspective
User can rotate the model across each axis with keys:
  Q and E rotate it across the Z axis
  A and D rotate it across the Y axis
  W and S rotate it across the X axis
User can change the model between Cube, Octohedron, and Tetrahedron with C, O, and T keys respectively
  Model change keys can also reset current model, if key pressed is same one as is presently shown
